## User Group Manager v2
Simple but helpful site to get details about upcoming events.

### Planned extensions
- Rest API to get event details and register
- Admin options to create and edit events / modify and delete registrations (no-shows)
- new page structure and re-build with Livewire

### Originally for "FileMaker Zürich"
UGMv2 is build but not limited to the FileMaker Zürich user group meetings.

----------------

This rebuild is made possible by some great open souce technologies: HTML 5, CSS 3, Tailwind, JavaScript ES6, PHP 8, Laravel 8, Jetstream, Livewire and MariaDB. To all the contributors of these repositories: you are our heros! What would we do without your tireless dedication..!

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
